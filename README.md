# Internship Tasks Repository

This repository contains four tasks completed as part of my internship. Each task includes a Jupyter notebook with the following details:

## Task 1: Credit Scoring Model

**Objective:**  
Develop a credit scoring model to predict the creditworthiness of individuals based on historical financial data.

**Approach:**  
- Data preprocessing and feature selection.
- Model training using various classification algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest).
- Model evaluation using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC curves.

**Dataset:**

## Task 2: Emotion Recognition from Speech

**Objective:**  
Build a model that can recognize emotions in speech audio, classifying spoken sentences into emotions like happiness, anger, or sadness.

**Approach:**  
- Preprocessing of speech audio files and feature extraction using Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC).
- Model training using deep learning techniques, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN).
- Evaluation of model performance based on accuracy.

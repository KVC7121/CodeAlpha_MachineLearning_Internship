# CodeAlpha Internship - Machine Learning Projects - Repository

Welcome to my GitHub repository, where I proudly present the projects I completed during my Machine Learning Internship at CodeAlpha. This repository features a collection of machine learning tasks that highlight the skills and knowledge I gained throughout my internship. Each project is a testament to my hands-on experience and growth in the field of machine learning, showcasing my ability to tackle real-world challenges with advanced techniques and methodologies.

This repository contains four tasks completed as part of my internship. Each task includes a Jupyter notebook with the following details:

## Task 1: Credit Scoring Model

**Objective:**  
Develop a credit scoring model to predict the creditworthiness of individuals based on historical financial data.

**Approach:**  
- Data preprocessing and feature selection.
- Model training using various classification algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest).
- Model evaluation using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC curves.

**Dataset:**

## Task 2: Emotion Recognition from Speech

**Objective:**  
Build a model that can recognize emotions in speech audio, classifying spoken sentences into emotions like happiness, anger, or sadness.

**Approach:**  
- Preprocessing of speech audio files and feature extraction using Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC).
- Model training using deep learning techniques, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN).
- Evaluation of model performance based on accuracy.

**Dataset:**

## Task 3: Handwritten Character Recognition

**Objective:**  
Create a system to recognize various handwritten characters or alphabets.

**Approach:**  
- Data augmentation and preprocessing.
- Model training using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to recognize characters from a dataset.
- Evaluation based on accuracy of character recognition.

**Dataset:**

## Task 4: Disease Prediction from Medical Data

**Objective:**  
Create a model to predict the likelihood of cardiovascular disease based on patient medical data, including features like age, height, weight, blood pressure, and various lifestyle indicators.

**Approach:**  
- Data preprocessing, including handling missing values, scaling numerical features, and encoding categorical variables.
- Addressing class imbalance using SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique).
- Splitting the data into training and testing sets for model evaluation.
- Model training using multiple classifiers: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.
- Evaluating the models using metrics such as accuracy, classification reports, confusion matrices, and ROC-AUC scores.
- Implementing an ensemble model using a Voting Classifier to improve predictive performance.

**Dataset:**
